# Comments
Java EE 6 focused project.

I also started applying what I learnt AngularJS in this project. You can see jQuery applied to registration, but I finally decided to use AngularJS in the rest of the application.

It would have been better to use Websockets instead of Timers/Intervals in order to get data, since it's way too much work, but due to deadline I could not do that. Maybe, someday, I will modify this.
